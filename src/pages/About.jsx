    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      I'm Aayushma Pradhan, a Computer Science major and Business minor at the University of Virginia, graduating in May 2026.

    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      I've held internship roles in software development, marketing, and education. At the Terma Project, I automated data auditing with Python scripts and redesigned a website using Figma to improve UX. I also contributed to a digital marketing strategy that boosted brand visibility by 25%.

    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      My passion for user-centered technology is reflected in my projects, including a JavaFX course review app, a responsive AI-powered travel assistant, and a Pygame-based game. Iâ€™ve led cross-functional teams, conducted user research, and delivered polished products through iterative development.
